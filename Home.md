# SWADE Immersive Macros (SWIM)
This is a selection of macros for Savage Worlds Players and GMs alike.  
If you want to support me you can do so on my Ko-fi:  
[![Ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/salieric)  
This is one way to show me that my module is actually used and well-received.  

## Usage instructions
You'll find all the macros in a new compendium delivered by the module. It contains all the macros. You can either import the macros or replace the code of your existing macros. Once that is done you can start using them although I strongly suggest taking a look at the module settings. There are quite a few which might be interesting for you.  
**Please read this ReadMe in full, as it contains important instructions on how to use this module.**

## Help needed!
Are you a creator of sound effects or art and want to contribute? This is great, I'd like to include some assets like macro icons and sound effects in here. Icons need to be square (or round), sound effects need to be short and easily recogniseable. If you want to include your work here I'll gladly give you full credit with links to your homepage for users to check out your other stuff.  
You have nothing to offer? Oh you're so wrong. Please [create issues](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/issues/new) here on the GitHub to contribute as well. Tell me which macros or functionality you want to see and inform me about bugs this way and I'll see what I can do about it. No promises I can deliver though and please no hard feelings should I decline your request. Please check for [open issues](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/issues) before creating new ones though.
